This query is exactly similar to Exercise 50, except that we use LEFT OUTER JOIN
Further we use NVL Function to display '0' instead of NULL in the output

FINAL QUERY:

SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME, NVL(SUM(P1.PRICE*S3.QUANTITY),0) TAMOUNT, NVL(SUM((P1.PRICE*S3.QUANTITY)*P1.DISCOUNT/100),0) TDISCOUNT
FROM  SALESMAN S1 LEFT OUTER JOIN SALE S2 ON S1.SID=s2.SID 
   	LEFT OUTER JOIN SALEDETAIL S3 ON S2.SALEID=S3.SALEID 
   		LEFT OUTER JOIN PRODUCT P1 ON S3.PRODID = P1.PRODID 
   GROUP BY S1.SID, S1.SNAME 
   ORDER BY SUM(P1.PRICE*S3.QUANTITY) DESC
