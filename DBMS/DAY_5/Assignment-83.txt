Given,
  1) ..of those employees who work in same retail outlet where George works... -> Self join
  2) Do not display George in result -> operator: <>

SELECT E1.EMPNAME, E1.DESIGNATION, E1.EMAILID
FROM EMPDETAILS E1 INNER JOIN EMPDETAILS E2
ON E1.WORKSIN=E2.WORKSIN
WHERE E2.EMPNAME='George'
AND E1.EMPNAME <> 'George'

E1 should be the final output table that doesnot contain the name 'George'
To fetch the retail outlet where George works we take another similar table E2 with only one tuple of George
and match it with the worksin with other employees.
