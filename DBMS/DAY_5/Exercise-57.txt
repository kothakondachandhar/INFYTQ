Method - 1:
SELECT s3.SID, S3.SNAME FROM Salesman S3
MINUS
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME
FROM Salesman S1 INNER JOIN Sale S2
ON S1.SID=S2.SID GROUP BY S1.SID,S1.SNAME

Method - 2:
SELECT x.SID, x.SNAME FROM  
(SELECT s3.SID, S3.SNAME FROM Salesman S3) x
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME FROM Salesman S1 INNER JOIN Sale S2 ON S1.SID=S2.SID GROUP BY S1.SID,S1.SNAME) y
ON 
y.SID = x.SID
WHERE y.SID IS NULL

Method - 3:(which I realized after 1 hour!)
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME
FROM Salesman S1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sale S2
ON S1.SID=S2.SID WHERE S2.SALEID IS NULL

Remember: AND and WHERE operators give different results...
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME
FROM Salesman S1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sale S2
ON S1.SID=S2.SID WHERE S2.SALEID IS NULL

SELECT S1.SID, S1.SNAME
FROM Salesman S1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sale S2
ON S1.SID=S2.SID WHERE S2.SALEID AND NULL
