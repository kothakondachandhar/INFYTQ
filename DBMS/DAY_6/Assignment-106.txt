Display the customer id and customer name of those customers   --> SELECT C.CUSTID, C.CUSTNAME FROM CUSTOMER C
who have not purchased at all -> NOT EXISTS
from any retail outlet. 
  --> Here we need to have some reference to the retail outlet. 
      Hence we use the tables Customer and PurchaseBill
      to identify which customers have purchased an item from a retail outlet.
Hence, we get

(
	SELECT CUSTID

METHOD-2:
SELECT C.CUSTID, C.CUSTNAME 
FROM CUSTOMER C
WHERE C.CUSTID NOT IN  
(
	SELECT CUSTID
