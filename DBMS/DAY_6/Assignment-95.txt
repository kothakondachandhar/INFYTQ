The management would like to know the details of the items 
which has maximum quoted price 
amongst the quotations that have status as 'Closed' or 'Rejected'. 

Display itemcode and descr of those items.

Filter Closed and Rejected Quotations.
SELECT * FROM QUOTATION WHERE QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed')

Find maximum price of those quotations.
SELECT MAX(QUOTEDPRICE) MAXI FROM QUOTATION WHERE QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed')

Fetch the itemcode of the quoation.
SELECT ITEMCODE FROM QUOTATION WHERE QUOTEDPRICE= (SELECT MAX(QUOTEDPRICE) MAXI FROM QUOTATION WHERE QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed'))

Display the details of the fetched item.
SELECT ITEMCODE, DESCR FROM ITEM WHERE ITEMCODE IN (SELECT DISTINCT ITEMCODE FROM QUOTATION WHERE QUOTEDPRICE = (SELECT MAX(QUOTEDPRICE) MAXI FROM QUOTATION WHERE QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed')))

However,  the following query doesnt show logical error:

SELECT ITEMCODE, DESCR FROM ITEM WHERE ITEMCODE IN 
	(
	  SELECT DISTINCT ITEMCODE FROM QUOTATION WHERE QUOTEDPRICE = 
		(
		  SELECT MAX(QUOTEDPRICE) FROM QUOTATION WHERE QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed')
		) 
	  AND QSTATUS IN ('Rejected','Closed')
	)
It is important that we also filter the 2nd inner query because max(price) from rejected and closed quotations
can also be the price for Accepted Quotation. Hence care must be taken that the quoation belongs only
and only to rejected and closed quotations.
