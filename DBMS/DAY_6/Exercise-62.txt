The given expected Result has two rows with SID = 1 and 5.
The tuple of SID=5 doesnot statisfy the condition as given in the question
hence I am unclear with the required output.
However, here is my answer that lists the tuples with the salesamount > Avg(salesamount)

A bit complex, but lets go step by step:
Step1: Fetch all the saleids and sids from the sale table
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SALEID FROM SALE S1 ORDER BY SID

Step 2: Lets fetch the prodid and quantity corresponding to every saleid
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SALEID, S2.PRODID, S2.QUANTITY FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2 WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID ORDER BY S1.SID

Step 3: Now lets calculate the amount generated with every sale
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SALEID, S2.PRODID, S2.QUANTITY,(P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY) AMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID ORDER BY S1.SID

Step 4: Similarly lets also calculate the discount amount
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SALEID, S2.PRODID, S2.QUANTITY,(P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY) AMOUNT, ((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*(P.DISCOUNT/100)) DISCOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID ORDER BY S1.SID

Step 4: Now lets replace the amount and discount columns with a single 'Total amount' column
SELECT S1.SID, S1.SALEID, S2.PRODID, S2.QUANTITY,((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100)) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID ORDER BY S1.SID

Step 5: Now we will calculate the total sum of amount generated by EVERY salesman.
To do it, we will "group by" SID and calculate the sum of total amount generated in the previous step.
SELECT S1.SID, SUM(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100))) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID GROUP BY S1.SID ORDER BY S1.SID

Step 6: Now lets calculate the average sales amount of all sales made
We will use AVG Function on TOTAL AMOUNT calculated in Step 5 
Incorrect Query:
SELECT AVG(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100))) AVGAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID 
Incorrect Query:
SELECT AVG(SUM(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100)))) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID GROUP BY S1.SID

Actual Correct Way to calculate average: 
SELECT SUM(SUM(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100)))/SUM(S2.QUANTITY)) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID GROUP BY S1.SID

Step 7: Now we will only select those SID's that have a total amount > Average
To do this, we will have to combine query in Step 6 with step 7

SELECT SID, SNAME, LOCATION 
FROM SALESMAN
WHERE SID IN (SELECT SID FROM
		(SELECT S1.SID, SUM(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100))) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID GROUP BY S1.SID ORDER BY S1.SID)
	      WHERE TOTALAMOUNT>
		(SELECT SUM(SUM(((P.PRICE*S2.QUANTITY)*((100-P.DISCOUNT)/100)))/SUM(S2.QUANTITY)) TOTALAMOUNT FROM SALE S1, SALEDETAIL S2, PRODUCT P WHERE S1.SALEID=S2.SALEID AND S2.PRODID = P.PRODID GROUP BY S1.SID)
)
