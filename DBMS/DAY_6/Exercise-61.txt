Step 1: Find the minimum quantity (which will be a single row)
SELECT MIN(SUM(QUANTITY)) FROM SALEDETAIL GROUP BY PRODID)

Step 2: Find the product Ids that have minimum quantity:
SELECT PRODID FROM SALEDETAIL GROUP BY PRODID HAVING SUM(QUANTITY) = (SELECT MIN(SUM(QUANTITY)) FROM SALEDETAIL GROUP BY PRODID)

Step 3: Using the prod ids fetched in the previous step,
relate these prod ids with the prod ids from the product table 
and display the description:
SELECT PRODID, PDESC FROM PRODUCT WHERE PRODID IN (SELECT PRODID FROM SALEDETAIL GROUP BY PRODID HAVING SUM(QUANTITY) = (SELECT MIN(SUM(QUANTITY)) FROM SALEDETAIL GROUP BY PRODID))
