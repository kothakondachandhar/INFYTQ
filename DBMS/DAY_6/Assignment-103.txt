Identify purchase bills in which -> Lets assign PURCHASEBILL 'P' table to the outer query
the bill amount is less than or equal to   -> P.BILLAMOUNT<=
the average bill amount -> AVG(P1.billamount) (lets assign PURCHASEBILL 'P1' to the inner query)
of all the items   -> GROUP BY ()
purchased in the same retail outlet. -> P1.ROID=P.ROID (The ROID which refers to the outer query must be the same as the inner query) 
					and GROUP BY function must group item prices as per ROID

Display billid and itemcode for the same.

SELECT P.BILLID, P.ITEMCODE 
FROM PURCHASEBILL P
WHERE P.BILLAMOUNT<=
(
SELECT AVG(P1.BILLAMOUNT)
FROM PURCHASEBILL P1
WHERE P1.ROID=P.ROID
GROUP BY ROID
)
